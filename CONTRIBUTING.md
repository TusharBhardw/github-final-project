body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of 
experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual 
identity and orientation.

* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or

threatening, offensive, or harmful.

reported by contacting the project team on [Slack in the #racial-justice-legit-info channel](https://callforcode.slack.com/archives/C01CRAN53CM). 

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

OpenEEW is an open source project and we are always happy to receive contributions from our community. You can contribute in different ways:

- Writing tutorials and blog posts
- Improving the documentation
- Submitting bug reports and feature requests
- Forking this repository and submitting a pull request
- Hosting a seismic sensor to expand the network (send us an email at [hello@openeew.com](mailto:hello@openeew.com))

Please read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/openeew/openeew/wiki/Getting-Involved) here.

## Technical Steering Committee (TSC)

The TSC will be responsible for all technical oversight of the OpenEEW project. Participation in the Project through becoming a Contributor and Committer is open to anyone.

The TSC may (1) establish work flow procedures for the submission, approval, and closure/archiving of projects, (2) set requirements for the promotion of Contributors to Committer status, as applicable, and (3) amend, adjust, refine and/or eliminate the roles of Contributors, and Committers, and create new roles, and publicly document any TSC roles, as it sees fit.

### Responsibilities

The TSC will be responsible for all aspects of oversight relating to the Project, which may include:

- Coordinating the technical direction of the Project.
- Approving project or system proposals (including, but not limited to, incubation, deprecation, and changes to a sub-project’s scope).
- Organizing sub-projects and removing sub-projects.
- Creating sub-committees or working groups to focus on cross-project technical issues and requirements.
- Appointing representatives to work with other open source or open standards communities.
- Establishing community norms, workflows, issuing releases, and security issue reporting policies.
- Approving and implementing policies and processes for contributing.

The TSC voting members are initially the Project’s Committers. At the inception of the project, the Committers of the Project will be as set forth within the CONTRIBUTING file within the Project’s code repository. The TSC may choose an alternative approach for determining the voting members of the TSC, and any such alternative approach will be documented in this CONTRIBUTING file. Any meetings of the Technical Steering Committee are intended to be open to the public, and can be conducted electronically, via teleconference, or in person.

### TSC Voting

While the Project aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any TSC decision requires a vote to move the Project forward, the voting members of the TSC will vote on a one vote per voting member basis.

Quorum for TSC meetings requires at least fifty percent of all voting members of the TSC to be present. The TSC may continue to meet if quorum is not met but will be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.
